            <h1>Is Software Engineering / Web Development for you?</h1>
            <p>This is an honest, no BS quiz, with the goal of helping you see if this is a potentially good career
                choice for you. Other quizes around the internet will only give you good results and prompt you to join
                their expensive coding school. At the time of
                creation there is absolutely no other quiz on the internet like this. It shouldn't take more than 10
                minutes to complete.</p>
            <p>
                Some questions will look at your personality while others will test if you the problem solving and
                critical
                thinking skills needed in these professions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some questions are about programming languages. Don't worrry if you've never used a programming language
                before. Just look at the question and see if you can figure it out. (Googling is okay, that's what
                Software Engineers do when they don't know something).
